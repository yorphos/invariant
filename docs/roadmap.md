- ✅ Prevents corrupted backups under active use

**Files Modified:**

**Technical Detail:**
The Rust SQLx path (used for transactions) did not enable foreign key enforcement. Now all DB access paths (both Tauri plugin-sql and Rust SQLx) consistently enforce foreign keys.

**Acceptance Criteria:** ✅
- ✅ Foreign keys enforced for all transaction execution paths
- ✅ No constraint bypass via dual DB access stacks

**Related:** ~~Technical Audit Finding 4.3~~ (RESOLVED - see "Outstanding Issues" section)

## Outstanding Issues & Known Limitations

**Status:** Documented, Low Priority, Acceptable for MVP

These items were identified in comprehensive financial and technical audits but are considered acceptable for the current MVP scope. They are documented here for future consideration.

### From Financial Audit:

#### Floating-Point Precision
- **Status:** ⚠️ ACCEPTED RISK (Low Priority)
- **Issue:** System uses SQLite `REAL` type for monetary values with 1-cent tolerance check
- **Why it matters:** Can theoretically cause "penny drift" over millions of transactions
- **Current mitigation:** `Math.abs(diff) > 0.01` tolerance in balance checks
- **MVP decision:** 1-cent tolerance is acceptable for small business use
- **Future consideration:** Migrate to integer-cent storage (multiply by 100) for absolute precision
- **Related:** Financial Audit Finding 3.3

#### Client-Side Invoice Numbering
- **Status:** ⚠️ ACCEPTED RISK (Low Priority)
- **Issue:** Invoice numbers generated client-side via `MAX(id)` query
- **Why it matters:** Race conditions possible if multiple windows open or sync added later
- **Current mitigation:** Single-user, local-first architecture makes this low risk
- **MVP decision:** Acceptable for target use case (single user, no sync)
- **Future consideration:** ACID-compliant counter or collision-resistant format (Year-Month-Sequence)
- **Related:** Financial Audit Finding 3.4

### From Technical Audit:

#### Report N+1 Query Patterns
- **Status:** ⚠️ DEFERRED (Medium Priority - Phase 5)
- **Issue:** Reports loop through accounts executing one query per account
- **Why it matters:** Performance degrades linearly with account count and transaction volume
- **Current impact:** Acceptable for typical small business datasets (reports <500ms)
- **MVP decision:** Premature optimization; current performance is acceptable
- **Future fix:** Rewrite report queries using grouped aggregates in service layer
- **Planned:** Phase 5 (Advanced Features) - Performance optimization
- **Related:** Technical Audit Finding 4.6

#### Test Suite Quality Issues
- **Status:** ⚠️ DEFERRED (Low Priority - Future)
- **Issue:** Some tests validate arithmetic in test code rather than production code
- **Why it matters:** False confidence - tests can pass even if production code breaks
- **Current mitigation:** Core workflows have been manually verified; 351 tests do provide some coverage
- **MVP decision:** Test refactoring is lower priority than feature completion
- **Future fix:** Replace math-only tests with integration tests using real DB
- **Examples:** `accounting-principles.test.ts`, `period-close.test.ts`, `expense-operations.test.ts`
- **Related:** Technical Audit Finding (Section 3), Findings 7

#### UI Layer Data Access
- **Status:** ⚠️ ACCEPTED TECH DEBT (Low Priority)
- **Issue:** Some views (especially `ReportsView.svelte`) query database directly instead of using service layer
- **Why it matters:** Business logic scattered between UI and domain; harder to maintain and test
- **Current impact:** Works correctly but violates clean architecture principles
- **MVP decision:** Acceptable for MVP; UI is functional and correct
- **Future refactor:** Extract report generation into service layer with proper boundaries
- **Planned:** Long-term architectural improvement (no specific phase)
- **Related:** Technical Audit Finding 4.1

#### Non-Atomic Workflows (Partially Mitigated)
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (Medium Priority - Ongoing)
- **Issue:** Not all multi-step workflows wrapped in database transactions
- **Progress:** Transaction wrapper added to persistence service in v0.1.1
- **What's done:** Invoice, payment, and expense creation now atomic
- **What remains:** Bills, inventory, payroll workflows not yet wrapped
- **Current risk:** Medium (reduced from High)
- **Future work:** Expand transaction wrapper to all remaining workflows
- **Planned:** Incrementally in Phase 5
- **Related:** Technical Audit Finding 4.2

### Summary of Accepted Risks

| Issue | Severity | Decision | Future Action |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Floating-point precision | Low | Accept 1-cent tolerance | V2: Integer-cent storage |
| Invoice numbering races | Low | Single-user acceptable | V2: ACID counter for multi-user |
| Report N+1 queries | Medium | Performance acceptable for MVP | Phase 5: Aggregated queries |
| Test suite quality | Low | Manual verification sufficient | Future: Integration test rewrite |
| UI data access | Low | Works correctly, tech debt | Long-term: Service layer extraction |
| Non-atomic workflows | Medium | Core flows fixed, others pending | Phase 5: Complete remaining |

**Audit Compliance Status:** ✅ All critical issues resolved. System is production-ready with documented acceptable risks.
